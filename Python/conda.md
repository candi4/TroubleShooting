## install
1. Download Anaconda Individual Edition in [the Anaconda official website](www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. Navigate to the folder where Anaconda was downloaded.
3. (Optional) Verify the data integrity using the sha256sum command.
    ```
    sha256sum Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```
    In the results window, copy the hash value and check if it matches the hash value shown on [Anaconda hash page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/hashes/).
4. Run the Anaconda installation script to begin the installation.
    ```
    bash Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
